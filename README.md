## Instructions

### Features & Requirements:
- Reservation
  - Start a Ruby on Rails project that is purely an API app.
  - Create one API endpoint that can accept both payload formats. See payloads at the end of this document.
  - Your code should not require any additional headers or parameters to distinguish between the 2 payloads.
  - Parse and save the payloads to a Reservation model that belongs to a Guest model. Reservation code and guest email field should be unique.
  - API should be able accept changes to the reservation. e.g., change in status, check-in/out dates, number of guests, etc...
  - Add a README file to the root of your repository with clear instructions on how to set up and run your app.
- Your submission should be available in a public git repository of your choice. Alternatively, you can submit a zipped folder of your source code

### Expectations:
1. Readable and maintainable code - use your preferred convention on separating the different logics, and put them in their appropriate places.
2. Scalable code - your code must demonstrate a clear path forward in the event a third payload is introduced.
3. Use of standard practices - treat your submission as production ready. Weâ€™ll look for proper error handling, tests, clear documentation, etc...
